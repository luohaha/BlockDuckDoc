# Basic EVM structure table function

There are five basic EVM structure table function supported on BlockDuck:

1. Blocks
2. Transactions
3. Logs
4. Traces
5. Latest block number

#### Understanding BlockDuckâ€™s EVM Structures

BlockDuck provides a streamlined approach to interacting with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) data through five main table functions:

1. **Blocks**: This table includes detailed information about each block within the blockchain, such as block number, timestamp, and miner details.
2. **Transactions**: Contains data on every transaction made, including transaction hash, value, and gas used.
3. **Logs**: Provides log data generated during transaction execution, useful for tracking events emitted by smart contracts.
4. **Traces**: Offers insights into the internal operations during transactions, allowing a deep dive into computation steps and message calls.
5. **Latest Block Number**: Displays the most recent block number, helping users stay updated with the latest blockchain state.

These structures facilitate efficient data retrieval and analysis, crucial for developers and analysts working with blockchain data.
